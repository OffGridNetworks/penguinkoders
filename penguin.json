The penguin access each text on demand, reads it a couple of times from different perspectives, compares it to online talks by contemporary luminaries, and thus becomes smarter with each question it answers;  it provides a few key insights not to miss about the text.  It puts the power of an IBM super-computer in the hands of an 8 year old, and accesses Koder, IBM, GitHub, Firebase and Google servers in so doing",
