		<h1>Implemented Today</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity management behind the scenes (restricted to 'Alex'), to avoid social logins per Hackathon rules, but you will notice 16 avatars assigned
                consistently to real users</li>
                <li>Anonymous-entry closed network with in-network identity that builds over time;  catering to the Under 13 market requires limited
                    collection of personal information.   Over time identity will emerge based on repeated and consistent behaviors.</li>
                    <li>Multi-channel chat environment;  switch rooms by clicking on the right;   creating and deleting rooms is available on the backend but
                        tied to identity so not shown is this entry</li>
                        <li>Multi-user chat environment, with per-user blocking</li>
                        <li>Private messaging (actually used by Penguin behind the scenes) but not enabled without identity profiles</li>
                        <li>Dialog flow managed by natural language engine with XML scripts for grammar, entities, default prompts, and guided flow<li>
                            <li>Generic plugin architecture with fully working example ("Language Insights");  intent is to monetize these for third parties at $0.03 per API call (50% premium over today's market value')
                              that brand sponsors, parents, PTOs will sponsor, and users will accumulate coins for new customer acquisition and can spend them in a micro-payment stream.</li>
                     <li>Language insights powered by several complementary APIs (get original content, get insights and sentiments, then get concepts, then get corpus relationships)</li>
                     <li>Original content sources enabled today included 46,000 full text books in Project Gutenberg (in public domain via Project Gitenberg), Wikipedia knowledgebase for concepts graph,
                         TED videos for corpus relationships, World Wide Web for any article on demand</li>
           <li>User interface that is content agnostic (event stream on left, entity management on right)</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>If our project is selected</h2>
           <ul>
               <li>Responsive and adapt for mobile form factor (a restriction of the hackathon suggested web apps);  run using NodeKit.io on iOS, Android, Windows devices</li>
               <li>Replace Firebase chat with more off grid approach (think of what happens when the Internet disappears)</li>
               <li>Add 4 more plugins (already wireframed and mapped in our mind:  1. Translation, speak write in one language and in milliseconds your partner hears/sees it in their native
                   language  2.  Privacy encryption over all channels assumed to be insecure;  rather than the under 13s using Twitter and Facebook, we want the 
                   privacy crowd to choose OffGrid Penguin because of its privacy feature.  Will be based on Secure Scuttlebutt algorithm.   3. Picture recognition with a daily or more 
                   frequent self-snapshot and recording of mood as assessed by Penguin.   Life logging to track and correlate to behaviors and health.  4. Math Engine.  Use
                   the natural language interface to provide the REPL of the calculator of yesteryear;  wireframed by our 9 year old).</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h2>If you <a href="https://github.com/OffGridNetworks/penguinkoders">star us on Github</a> </h2>
                   <ul><li>The next social network that isnt a social network but is an algorithm marketplace, where software is not created by companies but
                       rather by users and shared, Napster style.<li></ul>
