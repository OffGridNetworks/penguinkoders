		<h1>About this hackathon project</h1>
        This is a hackathon project that was started for the Koding.com HackSummit Hackathon on Saturday February 20 and submitted on Sunday February 21.
        It was designed and created by a family of an 8 year old, a 9 year old and an 11 year old and their father -- a team of four.

                <h2>Social Media for Under 13s</h2>
         The global social media market is $20-$50bn in size, with several billion users, and yet only a small fraction of this is knowingly targeted
         at under 13s.  The privacy laws by country requiring parental permissions etc. for any sharing of data make this a hastle that few of the 
         big players have chosen to address.  We've tackled this head on, with only the minimum of features provided with original identity that a user
         might bring to the network, and then we keep it closed so that.  But that was just where we started.  We really see this as a huge opportunity
         for cognitive avatars like Penguin who provide help from a composite of different services using a seamless, natural language interface. 
        <h2>Technology Overview</h2>
        The application consists of a multi-room community / chat interface that is supported by multiple parallel integrations with one of the most
        advanced cognitive platforms for natural language processing and machine learning.  It may seem odd to give a 7 year old a chat application
        that runs on an IBM supercomputer (well our younges team member turned 8 during the competition), but the idea is to provide a pluggable 
        framework that is designed from the start to allow advanced cognitive functions to be plugged in, and even shared by the users.   The advancement
        in cognitive algorithm is so profound, its estimated to surpass the cockroach within years, and primates in the lifetime of the younger team members;
        therefore, rather than build yet another social network, we've created a platform that is a learning platform for algorithms, that start with some
        useful basics, but will allow both users and machine to evolve together. 
         <br>
        The core technology includes:
        <h5>Evented-IO based on Node.js</h5>
    An asynchronous, evented back-end based on Node.js
     <h5>Linux-Caddy-In Memory-FireBase Stack</h5>
<p>A back end stack of Linux on the provided Softlayer Koding VM, but with Apache2 swapped out for a lighter weight Go lang
    reverse proxy server, Caddy, that creates SSL certificates on demand (checkout https://penguin.offgridn.com)</p>
<p>A lightweight front-end web client, with no bulky frameworks, just hand-tailored CSS and streamlined asynchronous communication
    with the backend.</p>
<h5>Custom Integration of Two-Way Real Time Asynchronous Protocol using Standard Web Technologies</h5>
<p>A custom two-way real-time communication protocol of XMLHTTP from client to server (to create a single page app for all but
    these static about pages) and Firebase running over WebSockets for deferred and event-based communication from server
    back to front-end. For example when requesting a book report, some data comes back straight away, but as the cognitive
    engine reads and learns more, it submits additional content over the Firebase channel.</p>
<h5>Firebase chat</h5>
<p>>Firebase API was chosen simply for fast productivity for the Hackathon, the eventual aim would be swap this out for an off-line
    friendly channel that works over school and neighborhood WiFi, and Bluetooth LE etc. for non connected scenarios.</p>
<h5>Firebase chat</h5>
<p>A custom set of integrations with IBM Watson Alchemy APIs; the APIs are straightforward, the differentiation here 
    is simply tying them all together in a robust way that works (even after only 24 hours of development) 
    in a very exensible model designed in from the outset.  Slack added bots way too late we think, and we are designing in
    bots and algorithms from the start.  Rather than coded logic for commands and logic flow, we use an XML-started but machine learning
    approach of Alchemy Dialog, which will eventually allow even end-users to add their own jokes instead of Siri's, have a modern
    answering machine that actually converses with your "callers" in a style that you'd be proud of etc.  We kept it straight forward for
    the hackathon to show a complete independent directory including script, plugin penguin.json file layout, and relied on the platform
    to provide the UI itself, a content-first appraoach.
    <p>The Watson samples online tend
    to be client-orchestrated, but we wanted a more balanced approach that allows any algorithm provider to offer their own. 
    We don't believe in a future of one Siri or one Cortana, but rather one where certain aspects of the cognitive processing
    are provided by the then prevailing best algorithm of the day. The source code of this hackathon project shows that that
    a plugin architecture works and actually allowed us to bring in Dialog, Language, and Insights APIs all from Watson,
    Chat from Firebase, and Content from Github/the Gutenberg project. This wouldn't be possible without a thoughtfully architected
    approach
<h5>Horizontally Scalable Cotent Sources</h5>
<p>Github and the Gutenberg project are used to provide 46,000 works of literature, in a readily indexed form that can be read
    on demand by the cognitive engine. When you request a "book report", Penguin doesn't just go to its archive, it (re)reads
    the text, determines the latests concepts and sentiments and provides them back</p>
<p>TED/Google YouTube: It's hard to explain to a child today what a 100 year old text really means, and so we use Watson's built in corpus for the Ted
    talks to present similar views articulated by the contemporary thespians of today. Give it "A tale of Two Cities", and
    Penguin will suggest three Ted talks with stated confidence of its conceptual linkage. Perhaps history does repeat.</p>
<h5>Standard Express Framework</h5>
Six other common Node frameworks are used to support the web server; again, nothing special in these choices, just chosen
    for familiarity by Hackathon judges and battle-tested maturity: async, body-parser, csv-parse, errorhandler express and
    request.
<h5>Javascript Code-First Development</h5>
Development is all in Javascript (front and back end with some shared re-use of code where appropriate), and the tooling
    we used was Visual Studio Code, with Github and Koding used as the storage repositories. The boys run Windows 10, the
    father runs OS X.
   <p>Testing was done by the boys and verified with use of both front and back end debugging tools provided in browser (Chrome and Visual Studio Code).</p>
    
    <p>Wireframes were done on flipcharts you can see in the background of our coding room</p>
